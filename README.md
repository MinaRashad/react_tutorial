# React Tutorial

This tutorial I am making for myself to help learn react.

I am more into data science and Artificial Inteligence but I heard that react is fun to code with.

I originally used vanilla javascript to create everything (and I mean everything). 

Feel free to use these as notes if you want.

I will be commenting all code as much as I can.
